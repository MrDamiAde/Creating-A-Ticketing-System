### Step 1: Create a Ticketing Site


I created a Site on Sharepoint for the Helpdesk team to manage tickets and for employees to create new tickets.
This site automatically came with a Tickets and Devices list.

This site automatically came with a Tickets and Devices list.


### Step 2: Create a form on Microsoft Form

I created a simple form for employees to fill out to submit a ticket. I chose to keep it minimalistic for this project, but in a real working scenario, information such as department, location, and images can be included in the form.

I created the first half of the flow to do the following:

#### 1. Flow is triggered when a response to the form is received

#### 3. Once the response details is received, it then sends the data to the "Tickets" list and a ticket is created
